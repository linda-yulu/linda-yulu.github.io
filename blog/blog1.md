# A project for my sanity 

**Date:** 2023-04-20

I decided to start a blog today. I am currently recovering from RSI, so everything you see was done through voice control. I'm currently experiencing a mini flareup, so I thought that having a little project would help me maintain my sanity as I wait this one out.

I'm not sure what I will put on this website yet. I will probably put something up relating to my experiences and tips on RSI. I may also put up some stuff relating to data science and programming, as I resume my learning.
